In building maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I emphasized modular design and clear documentationâ€”particularly in the development of the CRUD Python module during Project One. By separating the database operations into a dedicated module, I ensured that the dashboard interface in Project Two could interact with the data layer efficiently without redundant code. This modular approach proved advantageous as it allowed for easier debugging, testing, and future enhancements. Additionally, the CRUD module can now be repurposed or extended for other MongoDB-connected applications with minimal changes, demonstrating adaptability and reusability.

As a computer scientist, I approached the requirements from Grazioso Salvare with a problem-solving mindset that focused on user needs and system functionality. I began by identifying the technical requirements, such as the ability to filter animal records based on criteria like breed and age, and mapped these to features in the dashboard. Compared to previous coursework, this project involved deeper integration of user interface components with backend logic, which required me to adopt more iterative testing and modular coding strategies. In the future, I plan to continue leveraging design patterns, consistent naming conventions, and agile methodologies to meet varied client requirements when building data-driven systems.

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing systems that automate processes, manage data, and improve decision-making. In the context of this project, my work helps Grazioso Salvare better manage their shelter operations by enabling staff to quickly search for and visualize animal data based on mission-specific criteria. This contributes to more effective resource allocation, faster adoption decisions, and overall operational efficiency. Projects like this highlight the real-world value of computational thinking and software design in supporting organizational goals.
